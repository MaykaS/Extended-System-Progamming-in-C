Allocating and freeing memory.
Implementing linked lists in C.
Basic manipulation of "binary" files.

# task1a - 
implement
# task1b - 
implement the bcmp program
# task 1c- 
Add support to the -o, -t, and -k flags.
# task 2- 
In this task you will implement a code that restores the NEW file back to it's ORIG, 
using the diff_list you created in task 1b, and fseek. 
The bcmp program restores the NEW file back to its ORIG if a -r flag is given. 
After running the program with this flag, both ORIG and NEW will be the same as ORIG, 
and running the program on the files, would result in no differences.
